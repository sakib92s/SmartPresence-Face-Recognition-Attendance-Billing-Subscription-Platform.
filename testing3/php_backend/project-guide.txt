🧭 PROJECT WORKING GUIDE — SmartPresence-Face-Recognition-Attendance-Billing-Subscription-Platform
📘 Project Overview

The SmartPresence-Face-Recognition-Attendance-Billing-Subscription-Platform is a hybrid project combining PHP (Web Portal) and Python (Face Recognition System).
It allows organizations to manage employees, record attendance using a webcam, and store all records securely in a MySQL database.

The system works in two main parts:

🌐 Web Portal (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL) — for organization and employee management

🧠 Python GUI (Tkinter + OpenCV) — for face registration, image training, and attendance marking
⚙️ Project Flow & Working
🏁 1. Start from start.html

(Same as before)

🧾 11. Wage Muster Generation (NEW)

After attendance is recorded, the system provides a Wage Muster Generation feature to calculate employee wages based on attendance data.

From the dashboard, HR/Admin can open the Wage Muster section.

The HR can:

Select or upload the attendance Excel file generated by the Python system

Click on Generate Wage Muster

The system processes the file using the wage muster module and automatically:

Reads attendance data

Calculates total working days and present days

Calculates basic wages and salary components

Generates a formatted Wage Muster Excel file

The generated Wage Muster file is saved in:

php_backend/wage_muster_generator/generated/


The HR can then download the Wage Muster report using the web portal.

This helps HR and payroll teams use the report directly for salary processing.

🧾 Output Files Generated (UPDATED)

Attendance Excel File → Contains daily attendance records

Employee Joining File → Contains joining details of each employee

Wage Muster Excel File → Contains calculated salary and wage details

💡 Important Notes (UPDATED)

Ensure the camera is connected and has proper lighting.

OTP feature will not work without a valid Renflair SMS API key.

Python and PHP must be connected to the same MySQL database.

Before running the Python app, ensure your XAMPP (Apache + MySQL) server is running.

If you add new employees, always retrain the model before taking attendance.

Wage Muster can only be generated after valid attendance Excel files are available.
