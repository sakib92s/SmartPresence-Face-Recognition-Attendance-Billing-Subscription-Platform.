🧭 PROJECT WORKING GUIDE — FACE RECOGNITION ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
📘 Project Overview

The Face Recognition Attendance System (Advanced Version) is a hybrid project combining PHP (Web Portal) and Python (Face Recognition System).
It allows organizations to manage employees, record attendance using a webcam, and store all records securely in a MySQL database.

The system works in two main parts:

🌐 Web Portal (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL) — for organization and employee management

🧠 Python GUI (Tkinter + OpenCV) — for face registration, image training, and attendance marking

⚙️ Project Flow & Working
🏁 1. Start from start.html

The entry point of the system is start.html.

From here, a new organization can register if not already registered.

Existing organizations can log in directly.

🏢 2. Organization Registration

On the registration page, fill in organization details including:

Organization Name

Email Address

Mobile Number

Password

When a mobile number is entered, an OTP will be sent for verification.

📱 Important:
To send OTP messages, you need to purchase an SMS API from Renflair SMS Gateway
.

Once the OTP is verified successfully, the organization details are saved in the MySQL database.

🔐 3. Organization Login

After successful registration, log in with your email and password.

You will be redirected to the main dashboard.

🧑‍💼 4. Add New Employee (HR Panel)

In the dashboard, click on Add New Employee.

The HR login page will appear — enter your HR credentials.

Then, the Employee Registration Form will open.

Enter employee details such as:

Employee ID

Name

Department

Mobile Number (for OTP verification)

Email, etc.

Just like the organization registration, this step also uses OTP verification via SMS API.

Once verified, the employee will be added to the database.

🔎 5. Search & Manage Employees

From the dashboard, you can search employees by name, ID, or department.

You can also view, edit, or remove employee details.

🧠 Python Section (Face Recognition System)
🐍 6. Run the Python Script

Open your project folder and run the main script:

python main.py


A Tkinter login window will appear.

🔑 7. Python Login (Organization Credentials)

Login using the same email and password you used during organization registration on the web portal.

This ensures that only the registered organization can access the attendance module.

🧍‍♂️ 8. Add Employee (Face Capture)

After login, select the option “Add Employee”.

Enter:

Employee ID (must match the ID in the database)

Employee Name (same as in the database)

Once verified, click Capture Image.

The webcam will open and automatically capture 30 images of the employee.

These images will be stored inside the faces/ directory.

After capturing, the system will automatically train the model for that employee.

⏰ 9. Take Attendance

Go back to the main Tkinter window and click Take Attendance.

The webcam will open and start scanning faces in real time.

When a registered face is recognized:

Attendance is marked in an Excel file with:

Employee ID

Name

Date

Time stamp

Voice feedback (using pyttsx3) confirms successful marking.

The file is stored under attendance_reports/.

📅 10. Joining Record

When a new employee joins, the system automatically creates a separate Excel file named for the joining record.

This helps maintain a log of all new entries.

🧾 Output Files Generated

Attendance Excel File → Contains daily attendance records

Employee Joining File → Contains joining details of each employee

Both files are stored under:

PHP-BACKEND/attendance_reports/

💡 Important Notes

Ensure the camera is connected and has proper lighting.

OTP feature will not work without a valid Renflair SMS API key.

Python and PHP must be connected to the same MySQL database.

Before running the Python app, ensure your XAMPP (Apache + MySQL) server is running.

If you add new employees, always retrain the model before taking attendance.

🧩 Summary of Workflow

Organization registers and verifies via OTP → stored in database

HR adds employees with OTP verification → employees stored in database

Python GUI uses same credentials → allows employee face registration

Face images captured → trained automatically → stored in system

During attendance → recognized faces → attendance marked automatically
